# Flower_image_classifier
This repo contains code for an AI flower image classifier using Pytorch. This project is splitted into three areas:
The loading of the flower image datasets
Train the image classifier on the dataset
Use the pretrained classifier to predict the image content based on the topk most probable classes.
This project is based on pytorch. 
The project contains an IPNB file, train.py and predict.py file.
The train.py and predict.py are command line argument files also written for image classification.
The flower dataset can be gotten from:https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
